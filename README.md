# Bezlio Authentication

This is a first-step initiative to convert the authentication API of the Bezlio system into a microservice.  The initial goal is to convert our current C#.net layer with token-based authentication.  This should include connections to Chargify and DocumentDB for user authorization.

The next-steps initiative will be to add OAuth authentication, and possibly two-factor authentication based on client needs.

This is the first step of a larger initiative to convert different components of the Bezlio system into microservices.  The microservices will be written in Typescript combined with Node.js.
